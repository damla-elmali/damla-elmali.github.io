I am an Electronics and Communication Engineering student focused on artificial intelligence and autonomous systems, with a growing interest in hardware-aware and embedded AI. My interests lie at the intersection of algorithms and physical systems, particularly perception under uncertainty, embedded constraints, and system-level design.

I have hands-on experience in computer vision and autonomous driving applications, especially in object and lane detection for real-world scenarios. As a member of YTU’s Autonomous Vehicle Team, I worked with YOLOv8/v9 models, custom datasets, and ROS-based pipelines, primarily using Python and supported C++ components. These projects helped me understand that benchmark performance alone is insufficient unless a system is robust enough to operate under real-world constraints.

Alongside applied engineering work, I am involved in research-oriented activities. I am currently an undergraduate researcher supported by TÜBİTAK, contributing to a project on AI-aided design and optimization of Frequency Selective Surfaces (FSS). In parallel, I collaborate with the YTU Applied Artificial Intelligence Lab, where I study topics such as Federated Learning and Quantum Machine Learning, starting from theoretical foundations and progressing toward initial implementations.

My technical background includes machine learning, embedded systems, and introductory integrated circuit design. Through programs such as the National Technology Initiative IC Design track and international academic experiences including Erasmus+, I am gradually building a foundation that links AI algorithms with hardware, communication systems, and practical engineering constraints.

This website documents my academic journey, research interests, and projects. It is not intended as a polished marketing page, but as an honest record of what I am learning, building, and questioning as I move toward research-focused and international work in AI-driven engineering.
